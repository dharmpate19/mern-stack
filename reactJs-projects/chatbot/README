Note : - This is my project where i tried to understand how does react actually work so i have not used npx or npm for downloading reat library.

-To use react we have to add two library react and react-dom. react library is global we can use that for both web and app but react-dom is only used for web.
-To use react in file we add ReactDOM.createRoot(container). Every thing that we create using react that is added in this container.
-after that we use .render() ReactDOM.createROOT(container).render("Hello World"). render() help us to render something inside at container.
-React does nto use HTML it use JSX and browser does not derstand JSX so we have to conver JSX into js and to conver that we use babel. To use that we have to add bable library and add text type of script as text/babel when we add attribute type="text/babel" this attribute tell javascript to conver all jsx into js.
-To display multiple element in render we can create sinle element that has one container and holds all eelement we can also use array .render([paragraph, button]).
-In react the component name must start with capital letter i.e PascalCase.
-We can send data using porps.
-To use if else statement in jsx we can use ternary operation or { value === true && (displayValue)} the display value is shown.
-We use {} to send data in porp not "" because curly brackets helps us to give the value.
-In react when we use useState we do not want to remove revious data we want to keep copy of previous data for that we use [...previousState]
=(..spreadOperator) basically takes value from array and create new array.
-To add new value we just have to add new value after previous state setState([...previousState, newvalue])
-Lifting state up means lifitn state to outer component like here we lift state to app.
-In react state does not update immediately it update after the code is fineshed.
-When we send chatmessages first we use state to update chate messages with our message then we send use state to update message with chatbot message but this will not work becaue state willonly update after ode finishes so it will only update the last state message to counter this we stare our previosu state in variable and use that variable as previosu state for new state.
-Async means it returns a promise and promise means it is not available now but it will be available in future.
-To scroll to teh bottom we use scrollTop = scrollHeight
